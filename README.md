 A social network where you can add, share and discover new veggie recipes. With the functionality to search by ingredients or tags, as vegan, gluten-free, sweet etc. 
 I found out in many places I couldn´t find the recipe I wanted, like I filtered by vegan and gluten-free but appeared gluten vegan options, or gluten-free non-vegan options. Using VeggieVibe search Haystack functionality, that is not a problem anymore!


And of course it´s made fully responsive for mobile users:

Personalized forms on Django, tinkering with the source code of auto-generate forms: (Also users, is separated as a different app than recipes, to make it more scalable).

I'm currently working on the general aesthetic, specially the user profile and the CRUD views. I accept suggestions and tips =)
I also developed an API, and dockerized the project.
